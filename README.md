# A Vanilla JS Blog (WIP)

This project is about me practicing modern web development (CSS/SASS, Javascript and
HTML). Also to blog about it while building and sharing what I've learned.

## Stack and a brief explanation

-  Vanilla Javascript: I want to practice the actual language without frameworks. This way,
   I'll get to learn the technology that's under many of the modern frameworks and see how far
   I can go without the need of full-blown front-end frameworks.

-  CSS/SASS: While CSS frameworks serve their purpose, I feel they create more hassle than
   benefits, especially if you want to have a custom style. Nothing against frameworks;
   just wanted to practice the actual language.
